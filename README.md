# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Overview
This project analyzes customer data to predict churn and identify key factors that cause customers to leave. The goal is to help the business improve retention and reduce customer loss.

## Key Results
- Built an XGBoost model to predict customer churn
- Identified key drivers of churn using feature importance
- Provided insights to help target high-risk customers

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository from GitHub
2. Open the notebook file in Jupyter Notebook
3. Install required libraries (pandas, sklearn, xgboost, shap)
4. Run all cells in order
5. Review outputs and model results

## Limitation
The model may lose accuracy over time if customer behavior changes or if new data is different from the training data.
