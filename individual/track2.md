# Track 2: How Does a Recommendation Become Reality?

## Recommendation Implementation
A key recommendation is to proactively target high-risk (“Red Hot”) customers by encouraging a shift toward more stable payment methods (such as automatic payments) combined with enrollment in value-added services. This approach reduces friction in the customer experience, increases engagement and strengthens long-term customer commitment.

## Success Metrics and Baseline
The primary success metric is a measurable reduction in churn rate within the identified high-risk segment. The baseline churn rate from the analysis provides a benchmark to evaluate improvement.

A secondary metric is customer retention within the targeted group. At the same time, it is critical to ensure that profitability-related metrics such as average revenue per user (ARPU), do not decline as a result of the intervention.

## Measuring Impact and Risks
The effectiveness of this recommendation would be evaluated through a controlled experiment, such as an A/B test, where one group receives the targeted intervention and another serves as a control group. The difference in churn outcomes between the groups would quantify the impact.

Two potential risks or unintended consequences include:
- Allocating incentives to customers who may not have churned, leading to inefficient use of resources
- Creating customer expectations around ongoing incentives, which could reduce long-term pricing power and profitability
